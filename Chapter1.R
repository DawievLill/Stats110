#Let us create a new script for this project, to see how things work. 

#It seems that I can create scripts and git will pick them up. Can't use the nice user interface that is native to R.

v <- c(3,1,4,1,5,9) #Concatenate

sum(v) #Sum adds the entries of the vector

max(v) #Gives the largest value, whereas, min(v) gives the smallest 

length(v) #Provides the length .
